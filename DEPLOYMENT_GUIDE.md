# Navbar Fix - Deployment Guide

## What Was Fixed

The navbar was broken on the live GitHub Pages site because:

1. **Missing centralized CSS file**: The `css/navbar.css` file didn't exist
2. **Inline styles everywhere**: Each page had different navbar styles
3. **No responsive design**: Navbar wasn't optimized for mobile

## Changes Made

### ✅ New File Created

- **`css/navbar.css`**: Centralized navbar stylesheet with desktop-first responsive design
  - Default desktop styles (≥992px)
  - 5 responsive breakpoints down to 320px
  - Mobile vertical layout, tablet optimizations

### ✅ Files Updated

- **`index.html`**: Added navbar.css link, removed all inline navbar styles
- **`frameworks.html`**: Added navbar.css link
- **`side_proj.html`**: Added navbar.css link, removed broken style block

### ✅ Tests Verified

- All 191 tests passing ✓
- No errors ✓

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run these commands to deploy the fixes:

```bash
# 1. Check what changed
git status

# 2. Stage all changes
git add css/navbar.css index.html frameworks.html side_proj.html

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix navbar: centralized CSS with desktop-first responsive design

- Created css/navbar.css with responsive breakpoints
- Removed inline navbar styles from all pages
- Fixed navbar positioning and mobile layout
- All tests passing (191/191)"

# 4. Push to GitHub (this will auto-deploy to GitHub Pages)
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result

After pushing, GitHub Pages will rebuild your site (takes 1-2 minutes).

The navbar will:

- ✅ Load properly on desktop (centered nav, full buttons)
- ✅ Adapt to tablet (reduced spacing)
- ✅ Stack vertically on mobile (full-width buttons)
- ✅ Show consistently across all 3 pages

## Verify Deployment

1. Wait 1-2 minutes after pushing
2. Visit: https://mcello23.github.io/webpage/index.html
3. Check navbar on desktop (should be centered with gradient buttons)
4. Resize browser to mobile size (navbar should stack vertically)
5. Navigate to frameworks.html and side_proj.html (navbar should be identical)

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop** (≥992px): Full navbar, centered, 80px height
- **Tablet** (768-991px): Reduced spacing, 72px height
- **Small tablet** (576-767px): Icon-only brand, 68px height
- **Mobile** (≤575px): Vertical stack, full-width buttons
- **Very small** (≤399px): Compact sizing

## Troubleshooting

If navbar still looks broken after deployment:

1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear cache**: Browser may be caching old CSS
3. **Check network**: Verify `navbar.css` loads (F12 → Network tab → look for `navbar.css`)
4. **Wait longer**: GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to fully deploy
